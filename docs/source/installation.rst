Installation
============
The most recent release can be installed from
`PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/pystow>`_ with uv:

.. code-block:: console

    $ uv pip install pystow

or with pip:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python3 -m pip install pystow

Installing from git
-------------------
The most recent code and data can be installed directly from GitHub with uv:

.. code-block:: console

    $ uv --preview pip install git+https://github.com/cthoyt/pystow.git

or with pip:

.. code-block:: console

    $ UV_PREVIEW=1 python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/cthoyt/pystow.git

.. note::

    The ``UV_PREVIEW`` environment variable is required to be
    set until the uv build backend becomes a stable feature.

Installing for development
--------------------------
To install in development mode with uv:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git+https://github.com/cthoyt/pystow.git
    $ cd pystow
    $ uv --preview pip install -e .

or with pip:

.. code-block:: console

    $ UV_PREVIEW=1 python3 -m pip install -e .

Configuration
=============
By default, data is stored in the ``$HOME/.data`` directory. By default, the ``<app>`` app will create the
``$HOME/.data/<app>`` folder.

If you want to use an alternate folder name to ``.data`` inside the home directory, you can set the ``PYSTOW_NAME``
environment variable. For example, if you set ``PYSTOW_NAME=mydata``, then the following code for the ``pykeen`` app
will create the ``$HOME/mydata/pykeen/`` directory:

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    import pystow

    # Only for demonstration purposes. You should set environment
    # variables either with your .bashrc or in the command line REPL.
    os.environ['PYSTOW_NAME'] = 'mydata'

    # Get a directory (as a pathlib.Path) for ~/mydata/pykeen
    pykeen_directory = pystow.join('pykeen')


If you want to specify a completely custom directory that isn't relative to your home directory, you can set
the ``PYSTOW_HOME`` environment variable. For example, if you set ``PYSTOW_HOME=/usr/local/``, then the following code
for the ``pykeen`` app will create the ``/usr/local/pykeen/`` directory:

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    import pystow

    # Only for demonstration purposes. You should set environment
    # variables either with your .bashrc or in the command line REPL.
    os.environ['PYSTOW_HOME'] = '/usr/local/'

    # Get a directory (as a pathlib.Path) for /usr/local/pykeen
    pykeen_directory = pystow.join('pykeen')


.. warning:: If you set ``PYSTOW_HOME``, then ``PYSTOW_NAME`` is disregarded.

X Desktop Group (XDG) Compatibility
-----------------------------------
While PyStow's main goal is to make application data less opaque and less
hidden, some users might want to use the
`XDG specifications <http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html>`_
for storing their app data.

If you set the environment variable ``PYSTOW_USE_PLATFORMDIRS`` (or ``PYSTOW_USE_APPDIRS`` for
backwards compatibility) to ``true`` or ``True``, then the
`platformdirs <https://pypi.org/project/platformdirs>`_ package will be used to choose
the base directory based on the ``user data dir`` option.

.. note:: This can still be  overridden by ``PYSTOW_HOME``.
