-Why does this file exist, and why not put this in ``__main__``?
-You might be tempted to import things from ``__main__``
-later, but that will cause problems--the code will get executed twice:
-
-- When you run ``python3 -m pystow`` python will
-  execute``__main__.py`` as a script. That means there won't be any
-  ``pystow.__main__`` in ``sys.modules``.
-- When you import __main__ it will get executed again (as a module) because
-  there's no ``pystow.__main__`` in ``sys.modules``.
