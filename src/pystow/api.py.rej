-If you don't want to keep ``api.py``, check the following places:
-
-1. ``src/pystow/__init__.py`` contains a line
-   ``from .api import *  # noqa``. You'll want to delete this and likely replace
-   it with other imports for the most important functionality for your package
-2. ``docs/usage.rst`` contains a line
-   ``.. automodule:: pystow.api``.
-   You'll want to delete this and replace it with other imports
-3. You don't need to update any linting or testing configuration since it is agnostic
